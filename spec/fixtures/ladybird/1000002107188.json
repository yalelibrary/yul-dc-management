    "An apparently unrecorded eighteenth century American verse broadside. The poem recounts the tragic tale of a young merchant who falls in love with Lucretia, becomes engaged to her, then sails away to make his fortune. The text is surrounded by printer’s ornaments of four-petaled flowers, suns, and rosettes, including those used by Samuel and Thomas Green who were printing in partnership in New Haven, 1769-97."
