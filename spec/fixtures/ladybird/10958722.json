    "Binding: Quarter binding of bevelled wooden boards (worm-eaten) and brown leather; spine with three raised bands and paper title label with handwritten 17th-century inscription: “Vita / di S. / Girola.” On the boards marks of one clasp attached to the front board and on the front board the ca. 1800 inscription “JO.” written in black ink. Possibly the binding once belonged to another manuscript.",
    "Collection of Bernard M. Rosenthal (MS 38). Purchased from him on the Edwin J. Beinecke Fund.",
    "Description follow modern foliation which includes two preliminary leaves..",
    "Headings in pale red, often difficult to read. Yellow heightening of the majuscules. Initials, with guide letters written in the space reserved for the initial: (1) flourished initials (3-4 lines) in red with pale red (or brown) penwork or in blue with red penwork, sometimes with marginal penwork extensions; (2) at the beginning of each text a larger initial; the letters following this type of initial are majuscules. F. 3r: 12-line blue initial of the littera duplex type with extensive penwork in red and some blue, with decorative border in the same colours in the inner and lower margin and tendrils in the other margins containing flowers and acorns; the border of the lower margin terminates in a medallion containing a coat of arms; ff. 8r, 41r: 9-line initial of the same type and in the same colours; f. 47v: 6-line, idem; f. 77v: 7-line black initial.",
    "Script: Copied by one hand in a peculiar form of Southern Gothica Textualis Libraria under Humanistic influence as visible in the total lack of compression; special features are: the sloping hairline at the top of the second stroke of e, parallelled by the sloping stroke on i; h with exceptionally long curved extension under the baseline; the forked lower ending of f and straight s on or under the baseline and the forked descender of p; and the very fancy majuscules.",
