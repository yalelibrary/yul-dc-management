    "Three scrapbooks, compiled by Jane Wodening, containing correspondence, photographs, manuscripts, printed material, artwork, cut film, and objects documenting the work and family life of Wodening (neÃÅe Collom) and Stan Brakhage from 1958 to 1967. The correspondence consists chiefly of incoming letters and postcards from poets, filmmakers, and artists, many of whom came of age in the decades following WWII, and includes complete letters, often signed, and clippings or manuscript and typescript fragments of letters, initialed by Wodening. Letters discuss personal matters and the literature, film, and art of the period, as well as particular film projects by Brakhage. Correspondents include: Kenneth Anger, Robert Branaman, Jack Collom, Joseph Cornell, Robert Creeley, Guy Davenport, Edward Dorn, Robert Duncan, Clayton Eshleman, Jerome Hill, Robert Kelly, Peter Kubelka, Willard Maas, Gregory Markopolis, Michael McClure, Jonas Mekas, David Meltzer, Charles Olson, Carolee Schneemann, P. Adams Sitney, and Louis Zukofsky. There are also letters between Brakhage and Wodening and copies of outgoing letters",
    "Photographs in the scrapbooks include black-and-white and color portraits and snapshots of members of the Brakhage and Collom families, the five children (Myrrena, Crystal, Neowyn, Bearthm, and Rarc), friends, and correspondents. Photographs of people not already identified among the correspondents include George Gamow, Allen Ginsberg, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Orlovsky, Parker Tyler, Philip Whalen, and Richard Wright.  There are photographs of Brakhage by both Arnold Gassen and by Life magazine photographer [Minoru?] Iwasaki. Manuscripts include holograph and typescript drafts and copies of work by Dorn, Kelly, McClure, and others. Printed materials consist chiefly of clippings of writings, often fragments, but there are also printed reproductions of pictures and announcements for events. Clippings feature the work of Robert Branaman, Charles Olson, Ezra Pound, and Walt Whitman. There is also a complete copy of Creeley's chapbook entitled A Snarling Garland of Xmas Verses. Artwork includes original sketches and paintings by Brakhage and Wodening, the Brakhage children, Angelo [DeBenedetti?], Charles DiJulio, McClure, Meltzer, and one sketch, dated 1958, by Schneemann. The scrapbooks are accompanied by a statement by Wodening describing the method (collage) of compiling the scrapbooks"
